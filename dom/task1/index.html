    Did you ever hear the tragedy of <b>Darth Plagueis The Wise</b>? I thought not. It's not a story the <b>Jedi</b> would tell you. It's a <b>Sith</b> legend. Darth Plagueis was a <b>Dark Lord of the Sith</b>, so powerful and so wise he could use the <b>Force</b> to influence the <b>midichlorians</b> to create life... He had such a knowledge of the <b>dark side</b> that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many <b>abilities</b> some consider to be <b>unnatural</b>. He became so <b>powerful</b>... the only thing he was afraid of was <b>losing his power</b>, which eventually, of course, <b>he did</b>. Unfortunately, he taught his <b>apprentice</b> everything he knew, then his apprentice <b>killed</b> him in his sleep. It's <b>ironic</b> he could save others from death, but not <b>himself</b>.'
