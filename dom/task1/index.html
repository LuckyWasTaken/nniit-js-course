            Mike Krol - Like A Star


            4.2 lighyears away
            I was slow to being but I'm ready to fail
            I've been alone now for my whole life

            And I see black while you see white
            In the dark, I'm burning light for you
            And that way, you can follow me home

                I'm like a star
                I'm burning out fast
                I try to shine
                But it's never gonna last
                Can't you see you're just letting me down
                With all my friends, I'll make a big joke
                But in the morning I'll be gone

            I missing you during the days
            When the morning comes, I can't stay
            If you saw me now, I wouldn't grant your wish

                I'm like a star
                I'm burning out fast
                I try to shine
                But it's never gonna last
                Can't you see you're just letting me down  
                With all my friends, I'll make a big shoot
                But in the morning I'll be gone
