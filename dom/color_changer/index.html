    In mathematics, sine and cosine are trigonometric functions of an angle. The sine and cosine of an acute angle are
    defined in the context of a right triangle: for the specified angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side
    that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse), and the cosine is
    the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse. For an angle, the sine and cosine functions
    are denoted simply as
    sin
    More generally, the definitions of sine and cosine can be extended to any real value in terms of the lengths of
    certain line segments in a unit circle. More modern definitions express the sine and cosine as infinite series, or
    as the solutions of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative
    values and even to complex numbers.

    The sine and cosine functions are commonly used to model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves, the
    position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations
    throughout the year. They can be traced to the jyā and koṭi-jyā functions used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta
    period.
