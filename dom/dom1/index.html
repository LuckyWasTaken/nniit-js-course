    <h1 class="heading">City of Art and Sciences in Valencia</h1>
    <p class="content">The City of Arts and Sciences is an ensemble of six areas in the dry river bed of the now diverted River Turia in Valencia, Spain. 
        Designed by Valencian architect Santiago Calatrava and started in July 1996, it is an impressive example of modern architecture. 
        The "city" is made up of the following, usually known by their Valencian names: El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía — Opera house and performing arts centre; L'Hemisfèric — Imax Cinema, Planetarium and Laserium; L'Umbracle — Walkway / Garden; El Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe — Science museum; Oceanografic — Open-air aquarium or oceanographic park; Ágora — A versatile space that will allow the holding of varied events. 
        Surrounded by attractive streams and pools of water, it and the surrounding areas of the "city" are typically used as a relaxing place to walk day or night, with an open air bar outside El Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe during the evening.</p>
    <p class="content">This impressive set of buildings was designed by Santiago Calatrava, and offers different spaces where knowledge, culture and leisure are treated with the same architectural concept.

        The City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia is in itself a spectacle for the eyes. 
        It is “the most lively city in the world” and a reference point for leisure in the XXI century with infinite possibilities and activities for visitors. 
        The avant-garde image of the buildings that make up this impressive centre for leisure and culture, designed by Santiago Calatrava, is complemented with the attractive contents of the Hemisfèric and the Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe, the Oceanogràfic and the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía.</p2>
